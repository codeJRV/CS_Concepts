l-value : object that occupies some identifiable location in memory
r-value : any object that is not an l-value

int i;
int *p = &i;
i = 3;

class dog;
dog  


//const integer reference can be initializ3d with an r-value
// l-value can be implicitly transformed into an r-value
	but vice versa is not possible

r-value can be used to create an l-value, eg
int v[3];
*(v+2) = 4 here, v+2 is l-value
